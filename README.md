This is the Privacy Policy of Suada Haji ("me", "I", or "my"). In this Privacy Policy, I refer to my applications and services as the "Application." Please read on to learn more about my data handling practices. Your use of the Application signifies that you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") discusses the personally identifying information ("PII") that I collect about you through the Application.


If you are not comfortable with this Privacy Policy, please do not provide me with PII or other information or content or otherwise use the Application.

## Information I collect

When you install Application on your device I collect the following types of information from you:

I use Google Login so you can use your existing google account to access the features of the Application. You must explicitly authorize Google to share your information with me when you first login to the Application with your Google credentials.

You should review your privacy settings on your Google account because those settings determine and govern what PII may be made available to me when you access the Application. While Google Login allows me to access a variety of information about you based on your Google accountâ€™s privacy settings, I only access PII which I feel is useful to enhance your experience of the Application, including your name and email address


## How I use information I collect

I use or may disclose your PII only as follows:

* Administer your account
* Register you and provide you access to the Application
* Respond to inquiries or requests that you direct to me;
* To provide you with relevant content that you requested, using information that you allow me to collect from you
* To deliver to you any administrative notices, alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Application
* For internal operations, including troubleshooting problems, data analysis, testing, research, improvements to the Application, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other illegal activity
