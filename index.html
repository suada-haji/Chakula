<p>
    This is the Privacy Policy of Suada Haji ("me", "I", or "my").In this Privacy Policy, I refer to my applications and services
    as the "Application." Please read on to learn more about my data handling practices. Your use of the Application signifies
    that you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") discusses the personally identifying
    information ("PII") that I collect about you through the Application. If you are not comfortable with this Privacy Policy,
    please do not provide me with PII or other information or content or otherwise use the Application.
</p>


<h2>Information I collect</h2>

<p>
    When you install Application on your device I collect the following types of information from you:
</p>

<p>
    I use Google Login so you can use your existing google account to access the features of the Application. You must explicitly
    authorize Google to share your information with me when you first login to the Application with your Google credentials.
</p>


<p>
    You should review your privacy settings on your Google account because those settings determine and govern what PII may be
    made available to me when you access the Application. While Google Login allows me to access a variety of information
    about you based on your Google account's privacy settings, I only access PII which I feel is useful to enhance your experience
    of the Application, including your name and email address.
